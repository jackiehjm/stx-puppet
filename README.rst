The starlingx/stx-puppet repository handles the Puppet service [1]_.

The Puppet service runs during bootstrap, and at every reboot, to provide a
consistent configuration across the StarlingX system nodes.

This repository is not intended to be developed standalone, but rather as part
of the StarlingX Source System, which is defined by the StarlingX manifest [2]_.
